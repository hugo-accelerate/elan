# Elan

Elan is a Python workflow orchestration engine for AI agents, data orchestration, and mixed workloads. It gives teams a unified tool to build complex multi-step systems, from data pipelines to agent-driven applications, that stay explicit, composable, and predictable as they grow.

Elan separates tasks from orchestration. Tasks stay plain Python, while routing, branching, joins, and workflow structure are defined explicitly in the workflow layer.

It supports fine-grained routing, branching, synchronization, and dynamic execution within the same programming model.

## Highlights

- **One Tool for Data and Agents:** Build data workflows, AI agents, and mixed systems in one orchestration model.
- **Plain Python, Reusable Tasks:** Keep business logic in plain Python functions that stay easy to reuse, test, and compose across workflows.
- **Fine-Grained Workflow Control:** Express fan-out, conditional routing, value-based branching, joins, and dynamic execution directly in the workflow.
- **Simple Mental Model:** Keep tasks and orchestration separate so workflow structure stays readable.
- **Unified Execution Model:** Use the same orchestration model across Python code, YAML/JSON config, and HTTP API payloads.
- **Built for Mixed Workloads:** Use the same model for data workflows, AI agents, service orchestration, and human review steps.
- **First-Class Composability:** Smaller workflows compose cleanly into larger ones with explicit `result` boundaries.
- **Predictable Results:** Keep workflow outputs, result boundaries, and synchronization explicit.
- **DAG Opt-In:** Use DAG-shaped workflows when they fit, without making DAG constraints the center of the model.
- **Native Cycles:** Support loops and recursive agent patterns as part of the workflow model.
- **Type-Safe Data Flow:** Use Python type hints and Pydantic models for predictable data movement between steps.
- **Testable by Design:** Keep business logic easy to test in isolation.

## Quickstart

```python
import asyncio
from elan import Node, Workflow, task


@task
def prepare():
    return "World"


@task
async def greet(name: str):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"


workflow = Workflow(
    "greet_world",
    start=Node(run=prepare, next="greet"),
    greet=greet,
)

run = asyncio.run(workflow.run())

print(run.result)
# Hello, World!

print(run.outputs)
# {
#     "branch-1": {
#         "prepare": ["World"],
#         "greet": ["Hello, World!"],
#     }
# }
```

## Comparison notes

Elan is also documented against adjacent workflow tools to clarify what it means by dynamic execution and graph-native orchestration.
